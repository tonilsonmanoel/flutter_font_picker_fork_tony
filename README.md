Provides a `FontPicker` widget that can be used in a route or dialog as a UI for choosing a font from Google Fonts.

Depends on the [google_fonts](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts) package for loading and displaying the fonts.

Localizations available for ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ. 

## Simple Example

Inside your build method, use a button that when pressed, will navigate to the font picker screen:

```dart
PickerFont? _selectedFont;

ElevatedButton(
  child: Text('Pick a font'),
  onPressed: () {
    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
          builder: (context) => FontPicker(
              onFontChanged: (PickerFont font) {
                _selectedFont = font;
                print("${font.fontFamily} with font weight ${font.fontWeight} and font style ${font.fontStyle}.}");
              },
          ),
      ),
    );
  }),
```

The `onFontChanged` function retrieves the font that the user selects with an object containing details like the font's name, weight, style, etc. 

**You can then use its `toTextStyle()` method to style any text with the selected font:**

```dart
Text('This will be styled with the font: $_selectedFont.fontFamily',
      style: selectedFont.toTextStyle()),
```

## FontPicker settings

- `onFontChanged`: (required) the callback that returns a PickerFont object with all the details and methods for the user's selected font.
- `googleFonts`: A list of Google fonts to use in the font picker. By default it contains all 975 fonts included in constants.dart. **You should only use a limited number of them for performance and data saving**, as each font is downloaded and stored to the app's storage when it comes into view. Using up to 100-200 fonts should work fine.
- `initialFontFamily`: The font family to use initially in the font picker. Defaults to 'Roboto'.
- `showFontInfo`: Whether to show font details (category, number of variants) next to each font tile in the list.
- `showFontVariants`: Whether to show font variants (weights and styles) in the font picker. If set to false, user will only be able to select the default variant of each font.
- `showInDialog`: Set this to true if you want to use the font picker inside an AlertDialog (check examples).
- `recentsCount`: Fonts that the user selected before are saved to be shown at the start of the list. Sets how many you want saved as recents.
- `lang`: The language in which to show the UI. Defaults to English (`'en'`). Other options are ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ (`'es'`, `'de'`, `'it'`, `'pt'`, `'fr', 'pl', 'nl', 'ja'`). If you need a translation in another language: take a look at the `dictionary` variable in `translations.dart`, and send me (or fix) the translations for your language . 

## FontPicker features

The user can:

- Browse a list of any Google fonts you want.
- Select a variant (font weight and/or style) for each font.
- Filter the fonts by category (serif, sans-serif, handwriting, etc.) or available font glyphs (Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, etc.).
- Search the fonts by name.
- See the most recently used fonts at the top of the list.
